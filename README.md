# ePark

##  Project Overview

This project was made as part of a database management course.

**ePark** is a comprehensive park management system designed to enhance the experience for parents and guardians visiting theme parks with their children. This project provides an intuitive console-based interface for managing children’s park activities, from registering children and managing ride tickets to monitoring their activities with electronic bracelets.

The system enables parents to securely manage their child’s park experience while maintaining full control over ticket purchases, ride entries, and budget constraints.
